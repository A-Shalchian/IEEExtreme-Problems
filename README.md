# IEEExtreme Problems

This repository contains my solutions for IEEExtreme programming competition problems.

## About IEEExtreme

IEEExtreme is an annual global programming competition organized by IEEE. It's a 24-hour online challenge where teams solve algorithmic and programming problems.

## Structure

- **Python/**: Solutions implemented in Python
  - `tudor_gets_a_goat.py` - Solution for "Double Doors Regional P1 - Tudor Gets a Goat" problem
  - `Ship.py` - Solution for "The Cosmic Era P1 - Ship" problem
  - `IOI_101.py` - Solution for "DMOPC '17 Contest 5 P1 - IOI 101" problem

## Languages Used

- Python

## How to Run

Each solution is self-contained. To run a Python solution:

```bash
python Python/problem_name.py
```

## Notes

Solutions are optimized for competitive programming constraints and may prioritize speed and correctness over code readability.
